This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

To use the app you need to have a mysql server installed localy and add a `DATABASE_URL` to the `.env` file. In order for auth to work `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` needs to be set, and `NEXTAUTH_URL` should be set to local env. In order for the google auth provider to work you need to add `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` from your Google cloud console app (see .env.sample).

First run set node version using nvm:

```bash
nvm use
```

Then run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
